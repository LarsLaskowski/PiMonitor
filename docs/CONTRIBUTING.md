## Getting started

### Machine setup

{{TODO: Tools a contributor needs once: Git, the SDK/runtime of the stack (see `.squad/stack.md`, *Toolchain*),
the formatter and linters, anything else.}}

### Cloning the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/{{TODO: owner}}/{{TODO: repo}}.git
```

### Building and running

{{TODO: The *Restore*, *Build* and run commands from `.squad/stack.md`, plus the minimum configuration needed to
see the application do useful work locally.}}

### Running tests

{{TODO: The *Test* command from `.squad/stack.md`.}}

For detailed rules on how unit tests are structured and named, see [`UNIT_TESTS.md`](UNIT_TESTS.md).
**Unit tests are mandatory for newly written code** — see the checklist there before opening a pull
request.

## Submitting a pull request

Nothing is ever committed or pushed directly to `main` — every change goes through a separate branch and
a pull request.

Pull requests are merged with **Squash and merge**: the PR title becomes the single commit subject on
`main` and the description its body, so the commits on the branch are working history and need not be
curated. Keep the branch up to date by merging the current `main` into it (no force-push needed); do not
use the plain *Create a merge commit* or *Rebase and merge* buttons (see the process decisions in
[`decisions/process.md`](decisions/process.md)).

For PR naming use the following convention: `[area] Description` (no period at the end).

- For the area, use one of the areas listed below, capitalized. Issue titles use the same `[area]` prefix.
- For the description, do not reference an issue number in there. A clear, short summary of what
  the change entails is enough; there is room to elaborate in the description.

<!-- project:begin areas -->
Areas: `{{TODO: Area1}}`, `{{TODO: Area2}}`, `Tests`, `Docker`, `CI`, `Docs`.
<!-- project:end areas -->

When a PR is related to an issue, use the `Closes #issuenumber` syntax so the issue links to the
PR automatically and closes when the PR is merged.

The PR's label decides its section in the generated release notes (`.github/release.yml`): `breaking-change`,
`enhancement` or `feature`, `security`, `bug`; any other PR is listed under *Other changes*, and `ignore-for-release` leaves it out.

Follow the PR template in [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Contributions from outside

Issues and pull requests from forks are welcome. Changes in this repository are spec-driven: what a feature does
is agreed as acceptance criteria before it is built, and the maintainers own those criteria.

- **Bug fixes and documentation** may come as a pull request directly. Describe how to reproduce the bug, or
  link an issue that does.
- **Features and changes of behavior start with an issue** (the feature request template). A maintainer answers
  with the proposed scenarios and acceptance criteria; open a pull request once you agree on them, and link the
  issue with `Closes #…`. A feature pull request without an agreed issue is put on hold until there is one.
- **Out of scope for an outside pull request:** the AI squad and agent instructions (`.squad/` except
  `stack.md` and `project.md`, `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`), the
  text outside the `<!-- project:… -->` blocks of the template's marked files, and the workflows under
  `.github/workflows/`. The first two come from a shared template and are changed there, the workflows are the
  repository's own; the *Fork scope* check fails on the first two. Open an issue instead.
- **Checks on a fork:** pull requests from forks run without repository secrets, so the analysis that needs one
  (e.g. SonarQube Cloud) does not run there; a maintainer runs it before merging. Run the quality gates below
  locally so the pull request arrives clean. The CI run of a first-time contributor's fork waits for a maintainer's
  approval before it starts.
- Maintainers may push to your branch ("Allow edits by maintainers") or carry the change on in a branch of their
  own; you stay credited as co-author of the squashed commit.

## Quality gates

Code-style rules are documented in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and in
[`.squad/stack.md`](../.squad/stack.md), and are binding for all contributions. Before opening a pull
request, run the commands from `stack.md`: *Format*, *Build*, the *Analyzer gate* (no analyzer diagnostic
of any severity in a changed file) and the *Coverage gate* (line coverage on new or changed production code
and overall, thresholds in [`UNIT_TESTS.md`](UNIT_TESTS.md#code-coverage)). A pull request is
expected to arrive clean (see the process decisions in [`decisions/process.md`](decisions/process.md)).

## Versioning and releases

{{TODO: How a release is cut (e.g. a `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` release with its tag, created manually on `main`)
and what it publishes. Merging a PR by itself never publishes a release.}}
<!-- project:end releases -->

<!-- project:begin stability -->
## Stability policy

An essential consideration in every pull request is its impact on the system. Avoid introducing
unnecessary breaking changes, performance or functional regressions, or negative impacts on usability. In
particular, preserve the guarantees listed in [`.squad/project.md`](../.squad/project.md) (*Guarantees*)
and described in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) unless a change explicitly intends to alter one.
